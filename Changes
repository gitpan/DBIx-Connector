Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Connection.

0.12  2009-10-06T16:29:16
      - Fixed the GitHub links, which were still using the old name.
      - Removed `use feature` and `use utf8` from `t/pod-coverage.t` -- those
        were pastos from another project.
      - Removed `use DBD::SQLite` from DBix::Connector::Driver::SQLite. It
        will already have been loaded by the time that code loads.

      - Filled in the important details in the README.
      - Changed name from DBIx::Connection to DBIx::Connector, as there is
        already a module called DBIx::Connection on the CPAN.

0.10  2009-10-05T21:16:03
      - Initial version, with code borrowed from DBIx::Class, Apache::DBI,
        Catalyst::Model::DBI, and various other locales.
